# Simplify (simple script)

Simplify is a suite of scripts developed to enhance the understanding of projects.
It does this by utilizing natural language for all logic expression that is easily understood.
A big thing that prevents new people from becoming developers is the syntax, the logic they can understand.

By converting code into `Simple Script` what you're doing is abstracting away all the machine code.
Instead what you're doing is agreeing with the model on a pure text description of what you expect your files to do, regardless of what the code says.

### Plans

- `smplfy encode [generation count] [glob match pattern] [-r]` for a given glob match, will create [gen count] versions of a simplescript file for given code
